# eInk picture frame

<img src="https://github.com/fapeg/eink_picture_frame/blob/main/exampleimages/picture_small_1.jpg?raw=true" height="200" alt="picture frame" />
Digital picture frame made with a Pi Zero W, a Pimoroni inky impression and an IKEA RIBBA picture frame (10x15cm) which fits (almost 😅) perfectly! A cron job checks for new Mail every 5 minutes, automatically resizes the attached image to fit the eInk display’s resolution and displays it. You can also select the picture from your smartphone.



What you need:
-------------------

* Run the Pimoroni install script: https://github.com/pimoroni/inky for eInk support on your Pi
* Install feedparser for the atom feed news script
* Install imap_tools for the mail script
* Install ImageMagick for converting the image

Files in this repository:
-------------------------

### Display images by email ###
* **anyimage.py**: Fork of image.py from the examples in Pimoroni repository. Takes an image and automatically converts it to 600x448px which is the exact size the display needs. If you give it a vertical image it centers your image in a white margin. Also copies the most recent picture to the 'recentimage' folder so that you can revert back to the latest picture after displaying the news or other content 
* **getmail.py**: Checks your mail, gets attachment of the mail, sends it to anyimage.py for displaying it. Also creates a unique ID of the mail (generated by the time the message was sent and the sender email) and saves it in a text file so that when the script checks the mail again this email gets ignored, because the attachment was already saved.
* **maillogin.pwd**: Email/username and password in two seperate lines.

### Display an atom feed ###
* **feeds.py**: Get atom feed and create a html file for which is optimized for viewing on the display.
* **style.css**: Style the html file.
* **getfeedrenderanddisplay.sh**: Use headless chromium to take a screenshot of the html file with the right resolution. Display the screenshot on the display.
* **image.py**: The original image file from Pimoroni. I use it to revert back to the latest photo that was being sent to the picture frame after displaying the news for a specific amount of time a few times a day

### Smartphone admin area ###
*Warning: I wouldn't recommend running this on a pi that is reachable over the actual internet since I don't know if I did a good enough job escaping all the user inputs :P I'm running it in my local network, so it's fine..*
* I got a lighttpd running because I use RaspAP in AP-STA mode. I installed it to be able to configure the wifi settings anywhere I go but that's a little complicated to document lol so right now I'm focusing on the admin area
* **start.php**: Display the options to get mail and to display already saved images. If you click on 'get mail' this file also runs the actual script that checks your mail and displays the image in the picture frame (useful if you don't have a cronjob running or don't want to wait)
* **selectimage.php**: Show all saved images and display the one the user clicks on on the picture frame
* **wifi.png, pictures.png, mailpicture.png and bootstrap.min.css** not included for licencing reasons but you can get fitting icons on flaticon.com and the bootstrap file on getbootstrap.com
* **091_mod**: You also have to be careful with this file :D You can save it in /etc/sudoers.d/ and it's being added to the sudoers file. That is required because we run some shell commands in the PHP scripts which are being executed under the www-data user (because this users starts the lighttpd server). So I use the workaround and sudo the scripts, for that to be possible I define exceptions which programs the user can run in this file. It might not be a good idea to allow the user www-data access to commands like tee so be careful
